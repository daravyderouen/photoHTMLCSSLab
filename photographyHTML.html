    <h1>The Gift of Memories</h1>

        <h2>You are not going to remember everything, so take a picture of it.</h2>
    </div> 
    <h2>People often take for granted moments of their life that they wish that they could bring back.</h3>

    <p>I was born in a refugee camp. The only photography my parents have of me before we came to America is of this one. If you're wondering which one am I, I'm the smallest one in the photo.I know very little of my past.
    I often envy my friends who have ablums of family pictures to look at. I maybe have a few dozens in the last three decades.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Document a very important event in your life.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Make great gifts.</li>

        <h2>What do you need to start?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>At least one eye that can see, that's a must!</li>
            <li>At least one hand, or finger.</li>
            <li>A camera! (Whether it's on your phone, manual or DSLR)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! That is all you need!</p>
    </div>



    <div>
        <h2>Photography is a gift that keeps giving.</h2>
        <p> Whether I am taking my kids' pictures or a family event, I am guaranteed to capture a moment that one of them might not remember. </p>
