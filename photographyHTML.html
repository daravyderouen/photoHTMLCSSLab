    <p>I was born in a Thailand refugee camp. The only photography my parents have of me before we came <br>to America is of this one. If you're wondering which one am I, I'm the smallest <br>one in the photo.I know very little of my past.
    I often envy my friends who have ablums of <br>family pictures to look at. It wasn't until my father passed away in 2002 <br>& we had to find pictures of him that we
    barley had any to choose from. We didn't even own a camera! <br>That is how my journey with photography began...</p>
